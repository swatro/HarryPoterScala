Problem Discription: 
(copied from  http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?action=browse&id=KataPotter&revision=41)

- One copy of any of the five Harry Potter books costs 8 EUR. 
- There is a 5% discount for buying two different books 
- There is a 10% discount for buying three different books
- There is a 20% discount for buying four different books
- There is a 25% discount for buying all five books
- Note: These discounts do not cover the whole order. 
  - For example, if you buy four books, 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set. The fourth book still costs 8 EUR.
